# Introduction 

**This tutorial is part of a series on Red Hat Marketplace operator FP Predict Plus. Please refer to the `Prerequisites` section for `Getting Started`.**

### How to build a Machine Learning Regression model using FP Predict Plus

**`Machine learning`** is a large field of study that overlaps with and inherits ideas from many related fields such as artificial intelligence. The focus of the field is learning, that is, acquiring skills or knowledge from experience. Most commonly, this means synthesizing useful concepts from historical data. As such, there are many different types of learning that you may encounter as a practitioner in the field of machine learning: from whole fields of study to specific techniques.

**`Regression`** in machine learning and statistics is a supervised learning approach in which the computer program learns from the data given to it and make new observations or predictions. In this technique, the target variable has continuous values ranging from zero to infinity. 

Examples of regression problems include:

* Given historical data, predict the temperature
* Given historical data, predict the sales
* Given historical data, predict the house price

We will be using **`FP Predict Plus operator` from `Red Hat Marketplace`** to solve this usecase. Please refer to the content under `Related Links` section to know more about `FP Predict Plus operator` and `Red Hat Marketplace`.

# Prerequisites
